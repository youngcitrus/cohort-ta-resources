# Authentication Objectives
* Define the term authentication
* Describe the difference between asymmetric and symmetric cryptographic algorithms
* Identify "strong" vs. "broken" hash functions
* Implement session-based authentication in an Express application
* Implement a strong hash function to securely store passwords
* Describe and use the different security options for cookies

# Application Programming Interfaces Objectives
* Recall that REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer
* Describe how RESTful endpoints differ from traditional remote-procedure call (RPC) services
* Identify and describe the RESTful meanings of the combinations of HTTP verbs and endpoint types for both HTML-based applications and APIs
* HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
* Endpoint types: collections of resources and singular resources
* Recall that RESTful is not a standard (like ECMAScript or URLs), but a common way to organize data interactions
* Explain how RESTful APIs are meant to be stateless
* Given a data model, design RESTful endpoints that interact with the data model to define application functionality
* Use the express.json() middleware to parse HTTP request bodies with type application/json
* Determine the maximum data an API response needs and map the content from a Sequelize object to a more limited data object
* Define a global Express error handler to return appropriate responses and status codes given a specific Accept header in the HTTP request
* Define Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and how it is implemented in some Web clients
* Explain that CORS is an opt-in feature of Web clients
* Configure your API to use CORS to prevent unauthorized access from browser-based Web requests

# API Security Objectives
* Explain the fundamental concepts of OAuth as a way to authenticate users
* Describe the workflow of OAuth resource owner password credentials grant (RFC 6749 Section 4.3)
* Describe the components of a JSON Web Token (JWT) and how it is constructed
