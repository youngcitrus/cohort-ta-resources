## React Hooks Learning Objectives
1. Create function components that use state and other React features.
2. Use the `useState` hook to manage a component's state.
3. Use the `useState` hook to set a default state, instead of setting the default state in a `constructor()` method.
4. Use the `useState` hook to update state, instead of the `setState()` method.
5. Use the `useEffect` hook to manage side effect operations (i.e. data fetching).
6. Use the `useEffect` hook in replacement of commonly used component lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`).
7. Understand how to optimize your application's performance by skipping `useEffect` calls.
8. Use the `useContext` hook to access a context object, instead of a `Context.Consumer` or the static `contextType` property.
