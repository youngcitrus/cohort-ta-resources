## Expressions and Functions (W1D1) - Learning Objectives

### Expressions
1. Given a working REPL interface, write and execute a statement that will print “hello world” using console.log
2. Identify that strings are a list of characters defined by using double or single quotes
3. Given an arithmetic expression using +, -, *, /, %, compute its value
4. Given an expression, predict if its value is NaN
5. Construct the truth tables for &&, ||, !
6. Given an expression consisting of >, >=, ===, <, <=, compute it’s value
7. Apply De Morgan’s law to a boolean expression
8. Given an expression that utilizes operator precedence, compute its value
9. Given an expression, use the grouping operator to change it’s evaluation
10. Given expressions using == and ===, compute their values
11. Given a code snippet using postfix ++, postfix --, +=, -=, /=, *=, predict the value of labeled lines
12. Create and assign a variable using `let` to a string, integer, and a boolean. Read its value and print to the console.

### Intro to Functions
1. Define a function using function declaration
2. Define a function that calculates the average of two numbers, call it, pass in arguments, and print it’s return value
3. Identify the difference between parameters vs arguments
