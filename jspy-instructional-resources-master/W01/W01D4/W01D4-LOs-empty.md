## Advanced Array Methods and Helper Functions (W1D4) - Learning Objectives

### Advanced Array Methods
1. Utilize Array#forEach to iterate through every element in an array
2. Utilize Array#map to return a new array with elements based off of the original
3. Utilize Array#filter to filter return a filtered array based on a callback function
4. Utilize Array#reduce to return a value computed based on elements of an array

### Helper Functions
1. Be able to call a custom helper function within your own function. For example, define a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the primes.
