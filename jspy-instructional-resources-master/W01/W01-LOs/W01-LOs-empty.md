    - Approved Resources for this assessment:
      - MDN Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript


## Expressions and Functions (W1D1) - Learning Objectives

### Expressions
1. Given a working REPL interface, write and execute a statement that will print “hello world” using console.log
2. Identify that strings are a list of characters defined by using double or single quotes
3. Given an arithmetic expression using +, -, *, /, %, compute its value
4. Given an expression, predict if its value is NaN
5. Construct the truth tables for &&, ||, !
6. Given an expression consisting of >, >=, ===, <, <=, compute it’s value
7. Apply De Morgan’s law to a boolean expression
8. Given an expression that utilizes operator precedence, compute its value
9. Given an expression, use the grouping operator to change it’s evaluation
10. Given expressions using == and ===, compute their values
11. Given a code snippet using postfix ++, postfix --, +=, -=, /=, *=, predict the value of labeled lines
12. Create and assign a variable using `let` to a string, integer, and a boolean. Read its value and print to the console.

### Intro to Functions
1. Define a function using function declaration
2. Define a function that calculates the average of two numbers, call it, pass in arguments, and print it’s return value
3. Identify the difference between parameters vs arguments


## Control Flow and Arrays (W1D2) - Learning Objectives

### Control Flow and Arrays
1. Define a function that accepts a sentence string and two words as args. The function should return a boolean indicating if the sentence includes either word.
2. Identify a pair of mutually exclusive conditions
3. Given a for loop, translate it into a while loop, and vice-versa
4. Write a function that iterates through a provided string argument
5. Given a description of pig latin, write a function that takes in a string argument and utilizes String#slice to translate the string into pig latin.
6. Write a function that takes in an array of words and a string as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is located inside of the array. The function must use `Array#indexOf`.
7. Define that an array literal is an ordered list of values defined by using bracket and individual values are read by indexing.
8. Be able to concatenate multiple arrays together.


## Intermediate Functions (W1D3) - Learning Objectives

### Intermediate Functions
1. Identify that strings are immutable and arrays are mutable
2. Define a function using both function declaration and function expression syntax
3. Utilize Array#push, #pop, #shift, #unshift to mutate an array
4. List the arguments that can be used with Array#splice
5. Write a function that sums up elements of an array, given an array of numbers as an argument
6. Define a function that takes in a 2D array of numbers and returns the total sum of all elements in the array
7. Define a function that takes in an array of elements and returns a 2d array where the subarrays represent unique pairs of elements
8. Define a function that takes in an array of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest value in the array; if the array is empty return null


## Advanced Array Methods and Helper Functions (W1D4) - Learning Objectives

### Advanced Array Methods
1. Utilize Array#forEach to iterate through every element in an array
2. Utilize Array#map to return a new array with elements based off of the original
3. Utilize Array#filter to filter return a filtered array based on a callback function
4. Utilize Array#reduce to return a value computed based on elements of an array

### Helper Functions
1. Be able to call a custom helper function within your own function. For example, define a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the primes.


## Data Types and Structured Exception Handling (W1D5) - Learning Objectives

### Data Types
1. Use the `typeof` operator to determine test types of values
2. Use `Array.isArray` function to determine if an object is an array
3. Explain the difference between `null` and `undefined`
4. Use equality operators to determine if a value is `null` or `undefined`

### Structured Exception Handling
1. Briefly explain what structured exception handling is.
2. Use try-catch-finally blocks to catch errors.
3. Create a custom error with the `throw` keyword.
