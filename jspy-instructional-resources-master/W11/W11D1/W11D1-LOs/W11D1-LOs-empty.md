### Node HTTP (HTTP Full-Stack)
1. Identify the five parts of a URL
2. Identify at least three protocols handled by the browser
3. Use an IncomingMessage object to
- access the headers sent by a client (like a Web browser) as part of the HTTP request
- access the HTTP method of the request
- access the path of the request
- access and read the stream of content for requests that have a body
4. Use a ServerResponse object to
- write the status code, message, and headers for an HTTP response
- write the content of the body of the response
- properly end the response to indicate to the client (like a Web browser) that all content has been written
