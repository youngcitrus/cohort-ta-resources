1. Define NodeJS as distinct from browser based JavaScript runtimes.

  - global vs window
  - document (html of the page)
  - location (url info)
  - Require and module.exports (browsers have no notion of file system)


2. Write a program that reads in a dictionary file using node's FS API and
   reads a line of text from the terminal input. The program should 
   'spell check' by putting asterisks around every word that is NOT found 
   in the dictionary.
