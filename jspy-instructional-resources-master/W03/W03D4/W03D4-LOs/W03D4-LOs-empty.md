## Recursion (W3D4) - Learning Objectives

### Recursion
1. Given a recursive function, identify what is the base case and the recursive case.
2. Explain when a recursive solution is appropriate to solving a problem over an iterative solution.
3. Write a recursive function that takes in a number, n, argument and calculates the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.
4. Write a function that calculates a factorial recursively.
5. Write a function that calculates an exponent (positive and negative) recursively.
6. Write a function that sums all elements of an array recursively.
7. Write a function that flattens an arbitrarily nested array into one dimension.
8. Given a buggy recursive function that causes a RangeError: Maximum call stack and examples of correct behavior, debug the function.
