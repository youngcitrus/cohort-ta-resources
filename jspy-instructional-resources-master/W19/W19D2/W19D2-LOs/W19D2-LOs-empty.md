## Docker Containers (W19D2) - Learning Objectives
1. Recognize that Docker is an open-source project used to create, deploy, and run application with containers
2. Differentiate between virtual machines and containers
3. Differentiate between the two main types of hypervisors that enable virtualization: bare metal and hosted
4. Recall that containers are used to run processes in isolated environments
5. Summarize that a container is a unit of software that packages code and dependencies so an application can run quickly and reliably between different environments
6. Explain the lifecycle of a docker container
7. Summarize what a Docker image is
8. Explain how to start a container and the various flags that we may use with the command
9. Explain what happens when a container is started; what is the process for getting and starting an instance of the image?
10. Differentiate between how volumes and bind mounts store persistent data for containers.
11. Execute the `docker volume` command to store data and connect to none, one, or multiple containers at once
12. Implement the default `bridge` driver to define your own bridge network when running multiple containers
13. Recognize other Docker network drivers (`overlay`, `host`, `macvlan`, and `none`)
14. Execute a health check on a container with the `docker container run ...` command, a Dockerfile, or Docker Compose
15. Interpret the meaning of the three health statuses: `starting`, `healthy`, and `unhealthy`
16. Execute the `docker container ls` command to view health checks
