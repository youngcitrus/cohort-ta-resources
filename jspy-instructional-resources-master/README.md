# JSPY Instructional Resources Compilation

This repo is a compilation of the daily work/solutions, additional demo projects/lecture materials, and weekly reviews for the App Academy JSPY curriculum.

Each week has its own directory with a daily breakdown of materials. This has been updated with each pass that I make through the curriculum, so some weeks may be more out of date than others based on how recently I've been through those weeks and incorporated curriculum changes.

The `review-materials` directory has weekly materials that I have generally distributed as resources for assessment review. These typically include the compiled learning objectives (LOs) for the week as well as any practice assessments that may have been given.

Feel free to contribute new materials if you'd like! Always happy to incorporate other resources or add additional staff to the repo.
