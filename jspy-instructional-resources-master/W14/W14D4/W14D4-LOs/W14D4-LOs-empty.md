## React Router Objectives

1. Use <BrowserRouter> to provide your application access to the `react-router-dom` library.
2. Use <Route> to connect specific URL paths to specific components you want rendered.
3. Use <Switch> to wrap several Route elements, rendering only one even if several match the current URL.
4. Use React Router's `match` prop to access route path parameters.
5. Use <Link> or <NavLink> to create links with absolute paths to routes in your application (like `/users/1`).
6. Use <Redirect> to redirect a user to another path (i.e. a login page when the user is not logged in).
7. Use React Router's `history` prop to update a browser's URL programmatically.
8. Understand what nested routes are.
9. Be able to use React Router to create and navigate nested routes.
10. Know how to use the React Router `match` prop to generate links and routes.
