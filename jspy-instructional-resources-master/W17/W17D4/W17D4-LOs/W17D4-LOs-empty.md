## Classes and List Comprehensions (W17D4) Learning Objectives

### Classes in Python
1. How to use the `class` keyword to define a class
2. How to name classes
3. How to create instances from classes
4. How to initialize classes with the "dunder method" `__init__()`
5. How to use the "dunder class variable" `__slots__` to reserve memory for instance variables
6. How to make string representations of classes using the "dunder method" `__repr__()` for use by `print()`
7. How to declare instance methods for a class

### Inheritance in Python
1. How to specify a parent class
2. How to use `super` to access parent class methods

### Properties for Classes
1. Define a "getter" method for a class' property using the `@property` decorator
2. Define a "setter" method for a class' property using the `@<<getter_method_name>>.setter`

### Tree Refresher
1. Understand the basic structure of a tree, including the concepts of a `root` and `children`
2. Understand the algorithm of traversing a tree with a depth first search (what nodes would we visit)
3. Understand the algorithm of traversing a tree with a breadth first search (what nodes would we visit)

### List Comprehensions
1. Rewrite loops and `map()` calls as a list comprehension in Python
2. Choose between comprehensions, loops, and `map()` calls
3. Supercharge your comprehensions with conditional logic
4. Use comprehensions to replace `filter()`
5. Use a comprehension to combine lists into a dictionary
